# Distance analysis by R
This script was used in the article "Hematopoietic cell-derived IL-15 supports NK cell development in scattered and clustered localization within the bone marrow" by Abe et al. in Cell Reports.
Since this script performs vector-based calculations, 2D or 3D localization information of the cells is required. Detailed methods for cell segmentation and extraction of localization information from confocal imaging are described in the above-mentioned paper.
